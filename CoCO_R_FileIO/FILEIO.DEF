DEFINITION MODULE FileIO;
(* This module attempts to provide several potentially non-portable
   facilities for Coco/R.

   (a)  A general file input/output module, with all routines required for
        Coco/R itself, as well as several other that would be useful in
        Coco-generated applications.
   (b)  Definition of the "LONGINT" type needed by Coco.
   (c)  Some conversion functions to handle this long type.
   (d)  Some "long" and other constant literals that may be problematic
        on some implementations.
   (e)  Some string handling primitives needed to interface to a variety
        of known implementations.

   The intention is that the rest of the code of Coco and its generated
   parsers should be as portable as possible.  Provided the definition
   module given, and the associated implementation, satisfy the
   specification given here, this should be almost 100% possible (with
   the exception of a few constants, avoid changing anything in this
   specification).

   FileIO is based on code by MB 1990/11/25; heavily modified and extended
   by PDT and others between 1992/1/6 and the present day. *)
