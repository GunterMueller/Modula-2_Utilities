(*
 * Basic datatypes for Xlib.def and Xutil.def.
 * These should work with Mocka and mtc.
 * You may want to change them to suit your compiler;
 * Look at the next comment if your compiler has 16bit wide INTEGER and 8bit
 * wide SHORTINT. Looke at the second next comment for a general definition.
 * The types must have the sizes given on the right.
